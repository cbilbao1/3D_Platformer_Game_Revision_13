## This is the 13th patch of *3D Platformer Game*.

## Currently in BETA phase.

## Welcome to an indie fan game that I am making! It is currently a work in progress. It is inspired by Super Mario Galaxy / Super Mario 3D World, Grand Theft Auto / Spiderman PS4, Party Panic, and many other games. It is meant to be a jack of all trades game that people can play with their friends locally.

## My vision for this game was to reignite couch-coop games in an industry pushing for online multiplayer, which is why I emphasized the use of split screen and local multiplayer elements in this game during the beginning of its conception. However, online capabilities are planned for the future.

## I hope you enjoy it!
